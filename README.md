# Spamming-Project
This was supposed to be a web scraping project, but somehow I've turned it into a spamming project.
#Set up
Open the terminal, run "make setup". If you haven't got make on your PC then follow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows to get it.
#Running
Now type "python spamming_cfs.py" to run.
